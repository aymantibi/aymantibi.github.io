  This paper studies the economic effects of geographically targeted trade policies through the case of the Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) agreements in Egypt and Jordan. These agreements, introduced in 1998 in Jordan and 2004 in Egypt, granted designated regions duty- and quota-free access to the U.S. market conditional on using Israeli inputs. The program was highly concentrated in textiles and apparel, which accounted for the vast majority of participating firms. Using synthetic control methods, we find that exports to the United States rose sharply after implementation. While tariff reductions explain part of this increase, a significant share remains unexplained, suggesting productivity gains. Event-study evidence supports this interpretation: firms that begin importing from Israel experience large and persistent export growth, including to non-U.S. destinations, and this effect is driven by new entrants rather than incumbents. However, when comparing treated textile firms to firms in other sectors, we find only muted differences, suggesting that QIZs helped the textile sector catch up but did not lead it to outperform other sectors in production or trade. Finally, a triple-difference design exploiting the staggered rollout of QIZs in Egypt shows that treated regions experience higher employment and wages for men, with limited benefits for women. This paper provides the first causal evidence on QIZs using microdata and documents both firm-level and regional labor market effects of a trade policy shaped by geopolitical objectives.
