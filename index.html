      <p style="margin-top:8px; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.5;">
        This paper studies the economic effects of geographically targeted trade policies by analyzing the Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) agreements in Egypt and Jordan. These agreements, introduced in 1998 in Jordan and 2004 in Egypt, granted designated regions duty- and quota-free access to the U.S. market conditional on using Israeli inputs. Using synthetic control methods, we show that exports to the United States rose sharply after implementation. While tariff reductions account for part of this increase, a significant share remains unexplained, indicating potential productivity gains. To examine firm-level responses, we employ event-study designs. We find that firms beginning to import from Israel experience large and persistent export growth, including to non-U.S. markets, which supports the interpretation of productivity improvements. These effects are driven by new entrants rather than incumbents. Finally, using a triple-difference design that exploits the staggered rollout of QIZs across Egyptian regions, we find that treated areas experience higher employment and wages for men, with limited benefits for women. This paper provides the first causal evidence on QIZs using microdata and documents both firm-level and regional labor market effects of a trade policy shaped by geopolitical objectives.
